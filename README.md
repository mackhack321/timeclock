# timeclock
A Windows Forms C# timeclock with searchable logs and export functionality

This is a solution to the following task:

A company needs a timeclock worker tracking system. This system must collect the
time a worker logs into work and timestamp that to the workerâ€™s file. This system must
also keep a history of when the worker clocked in and clocked out, timestamped with
date.
The ideal workflow is:
1. Login
2. Attach time/date stamp of clock-in to worker file
3. Attach time/date stamp of clock-out to worker file
4. Searchable worker files with export capabilities
This also needs a GUI interface.
